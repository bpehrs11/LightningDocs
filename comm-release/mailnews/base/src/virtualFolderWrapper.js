/**
 * Abstracts dealing with the properties of a virtual folder that differentiate
 *  it from a non-virtual folder.  A virtual folder is an odd duck.  When
 *  holding an nsIMsgFolder that is a virtual folder, it is distinguished by
 *  the virtual flag and a number of properties that tell us the string
 *  representation of its search, the folders it searches over, and whether we
 *  use online searching or not.
 * Virtual folders and their defining attributes are loaded from
 *  virtualFolders.dat (in the profile directory) by the account manager at
 *  startup, (re-)creating them if need be.  It also saves them back to the
 *  file at shutdown.  The most important thing the account manager does is to
 *  create VirtualFolderChangeListener instances that are registered with the
 *  message database service.  This means that if one of the databases for the
 *  folders that the virtual folder includes is opened for some reason (for
 *  example, new messages are added to the folder because of a filter or they
 *  are delivered there), the virtual folder gets a chance to know about this
 *  and update the virtual folder's "cache" of information, such as the message
 *  counts or the presence of the message in the folder.
 * The odd part is that a lot of the virtual folder logic also happens as a
 *  result of the nsMsgDBView subclasses being told the search query and the
 *  underlying folders.  This makes for an odd collaboration of UI and backend
 *  logic.
 *
 * Justification for this class:  Virtual folders aren't all that complex, but
 *  they are complex enough that we don't want to have the same code duplicated
 *  all over the place.  We also don't want to have a loose assembly of global
 *  functions for working with them.  So here we are.
 *
 * Important! Accessing any of our attributes results in the message database
 *  being loaded so that we can access the dBFolderInfo associated with the
 *  database.  The message database is not automatically forgotten by the
 *  folder, which can lead to an (effective) memory leak.  Please make sure
 *  that you are playing your part in not leaking memory by only using the
 *  wrapper when you have a serious need to access the database, and by
 *  forcing the folder to forget about the database when you are done by
 *  setting the database to null (unless you know with confidence someone else
 *  definitely wants the database around and will clean it up.)
